                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <p><b>SmartWeights</b></p>
                <p>Currently designing and creating the SmartWeights application alongside a team of graduate students at Temple University. 
                    The app is designed to help users track their weightlifting progress and provide them with a personalized workout plan. The app will include
                    a virtual pet system that provides users with rewards for completing workouts and reaching goals. The app will require users to attach sensors to their
                    weightlifting equipment to track their progress and evaluate their form.
                    The app is being developed in Swift and Python and will be available on the App Store. The app is currently in the design phase and all documentation
                    can be found on the SmartWeights GitHub page and Docusaurus page:</p>

                <p><b>Checkers+</b></p>
                <p>Designed and created the Checkers+ application alongside a team of students at Temple University. This Checkers alternative provides users with a refreshing
                    experience and a new way to play the classic game. Using an open-source project consisting on a minimax algorithm, we created many features to allow users to customize
                    their experience and play against friends or the computer. The project heavily focused on the agile development process (scrum) and creating professional documentation that
                    includes sequence diagrams, UML diagrams, user stories, weekly sprint plans, and more. All app development can be viewed and downloaded from the Checkers+ GitHub page:</p>

                <p><b>Checkpoint Studios: User Experience Design Process</b></p>
                <p>Designed and created a prototype through the user experience design process with a fictional company called Checkpoint Studios. This final
                    presentation demonstrates how this process was carried out over the course of the semester to solve a presented problem related to financial needs. The process includes scoping and 
                    researching, creating personas and stories, constructing wireframes and a prototype, conducting usability testing, and creating iterations as a result of feedback. 
                    This project and coursework strengthened UI knowledge and used tools such as Miro and Figma. The presentation can be viewed here:</p>

                    <p><b>Movie Rating Predictions Using Linear Regression</b></p>
                    <p>Created a linear regression model alongside another colleague that uses an IMDb movie database. Film attributes such as actors, genres, duration, and more
                        were used for training the model. The linear regression models follows a 80/20 split of training and testing set. This project required many elements of data science
                        including filling and removing missing values, examining categorical features, normalizing data using standard scalar, calculating ridge regression with different
                        lambda values, and more. The source code, presentation (2-3 minute length requirement), and all reports (weekly/final) can be viewed here:</p>
